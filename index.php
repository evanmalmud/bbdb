<h2>Blood Bowl stats/results DataBase</h2>



<p>Welcome to BBDB, which stands for the incredibly un-original name of Blood Bowl DataBase.</p>

<p>This is a tool originally built to supplement the excellent BB Manager, but now with the demise of that it is built to replace it.</p>

<p>This website accepts uploads of games from Blood Bowl 1, published by Cyanide, stores the results for teams, players and matches, and provides information on all those things.</p>

<p>It also calculates league tables, so you can run your own league and keep track of it here in BBDB, rather than do it manually.</p>

<p>More and more features are planned to be added in the future, watch this space...</p> 

<p>Blood Bowl 2 support may exist in the future. But I'm not promising anything...</p>
